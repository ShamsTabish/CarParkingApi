## Project Description
Assume that we are building a street parking spot reservation service. Each parking spot is identified by its location (lat, lng). Users should be able to view street parking spots, reserve and pay for the parking spots or cancel their reservations. Build REST API's for the following and share the github repository with us. You can populate your database with any dummy data you want.
### Requirements
  • See available parking spots on a map
  • Search for an address and find nearby parking spot. (input: lat, lng, radius in meters. Output - list of parking spots within the radius).
  • Reserve a parking spot
  • View existing reservations
  • Cancel an existing reservation
  • Show the user the cost of the reservation
  • Please write Unit tests
#### Bonus
  • Automated tests
  • Require users to use phone numbers to sign up.
  • Validate that the phone numbers are real.
  • Additional features (whatever you think would be useful.)
